    "# Microsoft Movie Studio Recommendations\n",

    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to primarily assist Microsoft in creating a new movie studio by analyzing various data to identify the most profitable movies, top-rated directors, and genres among others. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data analysis will involve statistical methods and data visualization to determine currently popular movie genres. The resulting insights will provide recommendations to the head of Microsoft's new movie studio on what types of films to produce, as well as an overview of potential competitors.\n",
    "\n",
    "These recommendations will be based on empirical evidence and industry trends, enabling Microsoft to make informed decisions that increase the likelihood of their films being commercially successful."

    "## Business Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "As Microsoft has taken note on other big companies enjoying success by creating original video content, they also want a slice of the pie.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the big question is how?\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, I have been tasked to study what films are doing the best in the box office as well as to provide other valuable insights before a decision is made.\n",
    "\n",
    "The questions that were asked in analysing this data are:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What were the top 5 rated studios? \n",
    "2. What are the top rated genres?\n",
    "3. What were the most profitable movies?\n",
    "4. Who were the top rated directors?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These are relevant in answering the business problem at hand because as much as the profit made would be one of the key determinants of the success of the new movie studio, ensuring that the needs of the audience are met will ensure that Microsoft Movie Studio has an \"edge\" over the other studios through gaining a higher rating. This is made possible by identifying the top genres as well as directors."

    "We're looking at movies that were released between 2010 and 2018 and gathering information such as ratings, budgets, and domestic and worldwide gross profits. Our target variable is the profitability of each movie.\n",
    "Some of the properties of the variables we're working with include both categorical and numerical data types, and there are a few missing values that we'll need to address."

Next, I looked for missing values and outliers in the data. For missing values, I used imputation techniques to fill in the gaps, while for outliers, I used both visualizations and statistical methods to identify and address them. I believe these choices were appropriate given the nature of the data and my research questions, as they allowed me to conduct a thorough and accurate analysis while keeping the most relevant variables."

    "1. <b> Causation does not mean correlarion </b>\n",

    "As the saying goes, \"Causation is not correlation \", so while there may be higher ratings for certain variable such as genres, it may not only be the only factor leading to this result and therefore further analysis would be needed to provide a more accurate result.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. <b> Accuracy </b>\n",
    "\n",
    "The lack of using all the datasets provided as well as how to use them effectively is a limitation to the results provided which may therefore influence the accuracy of the results returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b> Future Improvements: </b>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "One area of improvement would be to complete a SWOT Analysis based on the findings as this would be beneficial to Microsoft and help in the decision making process.\n",
