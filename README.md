##   Overview 

This project aims to primarily assist Microsoft in creating a new movie studio by analyzing various data to identify the most profitable movies, top-rated directors, and genres among others. This is achieved by analyzing data that has been sourced from the IMDB SQLite database, The Box Office Mojo database and finally the Numbers Database.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was used in order to obtain the data. The findings of this analysis is further explored in the <i> recommendations </i> section here.


## Business Understanding

Microsoft is deciding whether to venture into the video content creation space as Microsoft Studio as they have seen notable success amongst other movie studio companies. 
However, as they are not sure about where to begin, as the projects data scientist, I have been tasked to run Exploratory Data Analysis, from which I will explore the films that are not only doing the best in the box office in terms of ratings but also in terms of profitability.
From this analysis, recommendations will be made in order to help in the decision making process.

There were 4 main questions that were asked in this analysis.

These included:

    1. What were the top 5 rated studios?
    2. What are the top rated genres?
    3. What were the most profitable movies?
    4. Who were the top rated directors?
